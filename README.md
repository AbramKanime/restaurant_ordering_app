## About Food Ordering App

The app showcases the food items with their prices available to a restaurant for order to the users. The user can add the items they want to their checklist and can remove any item from the list before completion of order. The checklist automatically adds and shows the total of the items added to the checklist. On completion of order, a modal is displayed on the screen for input of payment details for the order placed.

The app is built to be responsive to different screen sizes.
